            <h2>InfoSec professional based in the United States</h2>
            <p>
                Hello World! I bring a strong background of problem-solving and client-focused service to the field of cyber security. 
                My strong interest in the ethical implications surrounding the ubiquity of internet-connected devices, my love of learning, and the thrill
                of fighting adversaries in order to make the internet a safer place brought me to this career path.
                I'm CySA+ certified. I am comfortable speaking Python with computers, and I am comfortable speaking English, Italian, or Spanish with humans.
