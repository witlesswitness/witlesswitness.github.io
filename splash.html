            <p>
                Hello World! I bring a strong background of problem-solving and client-focused service to the field of cyber security. 
                My strong interest in the ethical implications surrounding the ubiquity of internet-connected devices, my love of learning, and the thrill
                of fighting adversaries in order to make the internet a safer place brought me to this path.
                I'm CySA+ certified, and I speak three human languages in addition to Python. I'm also a skilled cook, European wine expert, and amateur harpist.
